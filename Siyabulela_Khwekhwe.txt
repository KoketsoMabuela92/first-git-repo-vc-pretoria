Lyrics:
[Hook:]
How I learn my lesson but I repeat
Yea you Tell me go And you miss me
Baby come and tell me what's Missing 
Baby come tell me what's different
Text all week
I've been a mess all week
Leave you undressed all week 
You wanna take all week
Text all week
I've been a mess all week
Leave you undressed all week 
You wanna take all week
[Verse :]
He told you he love you but its all cap ohoo
If its set in stone where the rock at ohoo
I know you like talking Where the talk at ohoo
He just wanna know where the stock at ohoo
He told you he love you but its all cap ohoo
If its set in stone where the rock at ohoo
I know you like talking Where the talk at ohoo
He just wanna know where the stock at ohoo
Ohoo where stock
Ohoo where the stock at
Ohoo where stock
Ohoo where the stock at
Ohoo where stock
Ohoo where the stock at

Ohoo let me talk
Ask are you with me 
Man I'm down to try it 
You don't take no bull like you been on a diet
You don't like drinking but daym you a pilot 
And I see your body Your hips like a riders
You skrrrr on these nigga
Like daym girl your tires 
They finish your energy

Girl daym you tired I know

[Hook:]
How I learn my lesson but I repeat
Yea you Tell me go And you miss me
Baby come and tell me what's Missing 
Baby come tell me what's different
Text all week
I've been a mess all week
Leave you undressed all week 
You wanna take all week
Text all week
I've been a mess all week
Leave you undressed all week 
You wanna take all week
